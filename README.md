# Risk Assessment Analytics Platform

## Project Overview
This platform is designed to assess credit risk using machine learning techniques. It incorporates multiple data sources, utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict potential risk areas, and will include interactive dashboards for visualizing risk patterns and trends across different business units.

## Current Features
- Data ingestion and preprocessing of credit risk datasets
- Machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) for risk assessment
- Basic Flask API for serving predictions
- Feature importance analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning
- Flask for API development
- Matplotlib for data visualization

## Usage
Currently, the platform can be used locally for data preprocessing, model training, and basic predictions through the Flask API.

## Upcoming Tasks
- **Deployment**: The next major task is to deploy this platform to a production environment. This will involve:
- Containerization using Docker
- Setting up cloud infrastructure (likely on AWS)
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines
- Ensuring security best practices
- Setting up monitoring and logging

- **Dashboard Development**: Interactive dashboards will be developed using Tableau to visualize risk patterns and trends.

- **Performance Optimization**: The machine learning model and data processing pipelines will be optimized for better performance and scalability.
